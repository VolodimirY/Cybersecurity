# ☕🔍 Guía Introductoria a Mocha + Chai / Mocha + Chai Beginner’s Guide

**Mocha** and **Chai** form one of the most popular combinations for **automated JavaScript testing** within the **Node.js** environment.  

- 🧠 **Mocha** is the **testing framework** responsible for running and structuring tests, organizing them into logical blocks (`describe`, `it`, etc.).  
- ⚖️ **Chai** is an **assertion library** that helps verify whether the actual results match the expected ones, offering readable styles like `assert`, `expect`, or `should`.

Together, they allow developers to write **clear, expressive, and maintainable** tests, improving code quality and catching errors early in development.

### 📗 In this guide, you will learn how to:
- Install and configure **Mocha + Chai** in a **Node.js** project.  
- Understand the difference between **Mocha (test runner)** and **Chai (assertions)**.  
- Write and execute your first unit tests.  
- Read test outputs and handle errors effectively.  

🎯 **Goal:** By the end, you’ll be able to set up a professional testing environment to ensure your JavaScript applications run correctly.
