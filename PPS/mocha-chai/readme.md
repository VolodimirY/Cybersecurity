# ‚òïüîç Gu√≠a Introductoria a Mocha + Chai / Mocha + Chai Beginner‚Äôs Guide

**Mocha** and **Chai** form one of the most popular combinations for **automated JavaScript testing** within the **Node.js** environment.  

- üß† **Mocha** is the **testing framework** responsible for running and structuring tests, organizing them into logical blocks (`describe`, `it`, etc.).  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Chai** is an **assertion library** that helps verify whether the actual results match the expected ones, offering readable styles like `assert`, `expect`, or `should`.

Together, they allow developers to write **clear, expressive, and maintainable** tests, improving code quality and catching errors early in development.

### üìó In this guide, you will learn how to:
- Install and configure **Mocha + Chai** in a **Node.js** project.  
- Understand the difference between **Mocha (test runner)** and **Chai (assertions)**.  
- Write and execute your first unit tests.  
- Read test outputs and handle errors effectively.  

üéØ **Goal:** By the end, you‚Äôll be able to set up a professional testing environment to ensure your JavaScript applications run correctly.

First of all we need to download node and npm, you can check if its correctly installed by typing  `node -v; npm -v`

Once you got this, create a new folder and type `npm init`

Now we need to download *Mocha framework*  with this command `npm install mocha --save` and now we can find that two new files have been added.

Now we got evetiching we needed, lets try to code something simple, like this 3 calculator functions.

This is my configuration file, we need to specify the assert (chai) and the programm we are targeting (calculator2):

`var assert = require("chai").assert;`

`var calculator = require("../app/calculator2");`

After setting up everyting, we need to run the command `npm test`. As you can see, we got all correct because the functions returned right answers.

I just showed you the basics of this stack, now we are going to introduce it futher. Those are the functions that we can use hooks: 

`before(function() {
    // It is executed before all block tests.
  }); `
  
  `after(function() {
    // It is executed before after block tests.
  });`
  
 ` beforeEach(function() {
    // It is executed before each block test
  });`
  
  `afterEach(function() {
    // It is executed after each block test
  });
`
If we got a massive amount of tests at some point, we can use only() and skip() functions:
